# Introduction to programming language:
Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. A Program is a setoff instructions written in a programming language that performs a specific task. 
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows developers to write clear, logical code for both small and large-scale projects.

# 1.1 variables:
A variable in Python is a named location in memory used to store data values that can be changed during program execution.
* name = "somu" string
* age = 30 integer
* height = 5.9 float
* is_emp = true boolean

# 1.2 Data types:
Data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold in Python. They determine how the computer interprets and stores values.
*	int age = 30
* float height = 5.9
*	str name ="somu‚Äù
*	bool is_student = true
*	list fruits = ["apple","orange"]
*	tuple age = (28,30,32)
*	dict student = {"name":"Somu","age":30}
# 2 Command Line Basics:
The command line is a text-based interface used to run Python programs and interact with the Python interpreter directly using commands.
*	python --version shows the installed python version
*	python file.py Runs a python program
*	pip list lists all installed packages

# 4.1 Variables:
A variable is one of the most fundamental concepts in programming.
It is used to store data values that can change (or vary) during the execution of a program.

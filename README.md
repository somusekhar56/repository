# Introduction to programming language:
Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. A Program is a setoff instructions written in a programming language that performs a specific task. 
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows developers to write clear, logical code for both small and large-scale projects.

# 1.1 variables:
A variable in Python is a named location in memory used to store data values that can be changed during program execution.
* name = "somu" string
* age = 30 integer
* height = 5.9 float
* is_emp = true boolean

# 1.2 Data types:
Data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold in Python. They determine how the computer interprets and stores values.
*	int age = 30
* float height = 5.9
*	str name ="somu”
*	bool is_student = true
*	list fruits = ["apple","orange"]
*	tuple age = (28,30,32)
*	dict student = {"name":"Somu","age":30}
# 2 Command Line Basics:
The command line is a text-based interface used to run Python programs and interact with the Python interpreter directly using commands.
*	python --version shows the installed python version
*	python file.py Runs a python program
*	pip list lists all installed packages

# 4.1 Variables:
A variable is one of the most fundamental concepts in programming.
It is used to store data values that can change (or vary) during the execution of a program.

# 4.2 Control flow statements:
# conditional statement:
# if statement:
<img width="1046" height="218" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82f2c53d-5b70-461b-992d-41a8f150381c" />

# if else statement:
One block runs if the condition is true.The other block runs if the condition is false. if checks a condition — executes code if it’s True.else runs only if the condition is False.
<img width="1082" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8034ea91-0177-4b2b-a9a0-88cf4997eb98" />

# elif statement:
It lets you test more than one condition, one after another.

# 5 looping statement:
# 5.1 for loop:

A loop allows your program to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is True.

# Python has two main types of loops:
* for loop → used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range).
* while loop → runs while a condition remains True.

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

# 5.2 While loop:
A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is True.
Once the condition becomes False, the loop stops.

# 6 Functions and modules:
 # 6.1 Functions:
 A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.You define it once, and you can reuse it anywhere in your program.
 <img width="1142" height="248" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7360b9b2-0342-46e0-8587-7a94f46cb170" />

 # 6.2 Modules:
 Consider a module to be the same as a code library.A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

# 7 Data structures:
# 7.1 Lists:
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.Lists are created using square brackets.A list in Python is an ordered collection of items that can store multiple values in a single variable.

# 7.2 Dictionaries:

A dictionary in Python is an unordered, mutable collection of data stored in key–value pairs.Each key is unique, and it maps to a specific value.
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
# 7.3 Tuple:
A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items in Python, used to store multiple values in a single variable.
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# 7.4 Set:
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable and the duplicates are automatically removed.

# 8 File Handling:
File handling in Python allows you to create, read, write, and delete files stored on your computer.It uses the built-in function open() to access files.

# 9 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
# 9.1 classes and objects:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of the object. An object is an instance (or a real example) of a class.When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created.
<img width="1189" height="463" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b45823d6-c0c4-440f-ad26-7491778841d4" />
<img width="1093" height="477" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc1b34a-1b76-45f4-bb60-5042a0e921f1" />

# 9.2 inheritance and polymorphism:
# Inheritance:
Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class).It helps to reuse code and create a hierarchy between classes.
<img width="1154" height="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/468e534d-6a85-4e06-a011-d892ff451334" />

# Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means “many forms”.It allows different classes to have methods with the same name, but with different behaviors.

<img width="1201" height="403" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6535447e-f556-41f1-8f01-3b9c8ec11b6a" />

# Abstraction:
The process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from user is called abstraction.
<img width="1234" height="477" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435b48f7-4c9d-4994-86a2-b6dd36c81657" />

# Encapsulation:
Encapsulation means binding data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit usually a class — and restricting direct access to some data for security.It hides the object’s internal details and only allows controlled access using methods.
Wrapping of variables and methods into single unit.

# Error Handling:
Error Handling in Python is the process of detecting and responding to errors that occur while a program is running, without stopping the entire program. Python provides a mechanism called Exception Handling to deal with errors safely. Error Handling helps your program continue running even when something goes wrong.

Decorators:
A decorator is a function that takes another function as input, adds some functionality to it, and returns it — all without modifying the original function. Decorators wrap a function to extend its behavior.

@decorator_function → attaches the decorator
It wraps the original function with extra code (the wrapper)
The wrapper_function() runs before and after the original function

# Generators:
A Generator in Python is a special type of function that allows you to generate values one at a time, instead of returning them all at once. Generators are functions that remember their state and produce data lazily (one value at a time).

# 11.3 Lambda Functions:
A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function — meaning it has no name and is defined using the keyword lambda.

In simple terms:
Lambda functions let you create small, one-line functions without using def.
A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined without a name.It take any number of arguments and it Can have only one expression.

map() applies a function to all items in a list (or iterable) and returns a map object.
filter() returns only the items in a list (or iterable) that satisfy a condition.
sorted() returns a new sorted list from any iterable.list.sort() sorts the list in-place.
reduce() applies a function cumulatively to items of an iterable to reduce it to a single value.

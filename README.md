# Introduction to programming language:
Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. A Program is a setoff instructions written in a programming language that performs a specific task. 
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows developers to write clear, logical code for both small and large-scale projects.

# 1.1 variables:
A variable in Python is a named location in memory used to store data values that can be changed during program execution.
* name = "somu" string
* age = 30 integer
* height = 5.9 float
* is_emp = true boolean

# 1.2 Data types:
Data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold in Python. They determine how the computer interprets and stores values.
*	int age = 30
* float height = 5.9
*	str name ="somu”
*	bool is_student = true
*	list fruits = ["apple","orange"]
*	tuple age = (28,30,32)
*	dict student = {"name":"Somu","age":30}
# 2 Command Line Basics:
The command line is a text-based interface used to run Python programs and interact with the Python interpreter directly using commands.
*	python --version shows the installed python version
*	python file.py Runs a python program
*	pip list lists all installed packages

# 4.1 Variables:
A variable is one of the most fundamental concepts in programming.
It is used to store data values that can change (or vary) during the execution of a program.

# 4.2 Control flow statements:
# conditional statement:
# if statement:

# if else statement:
One block runs if the condition is true.The other block runs if the condition is false. if checks a condition — executes code if it’s True.else runs only if the condition is False.

# elif statement:
It lets you test more than one condition, one after another.

# 5 looping statement:
# 5.1 for loop:

A loop allows your program to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is True.

# Python has two main types of loops:
* for loop → used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range).
* while loop → runs while a condition remains True.

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

# 5.2 While loop:
A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is True.
Once the condition becomes False, the loop stops.

# 6 Functions and modules:
 # 6.1 Functions:
 A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.You define it once, and you can reuse it anywhere in your program.

 # 6.2 Modules:
 Consider a module to be the same as a code library.A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

# 7 Data structures:
# 7.1 Lists:
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.Lists are created using square brackets.A list in Python is an ordered collection of items that can store multiple values in a single variable.

# 7.2 Dictionaries:

A dictionary in Python is an unordered, mutable collection of data stored in key–value pairs.Each key is unique, and it maps to a specific value.
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
